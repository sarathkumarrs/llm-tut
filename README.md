# My Python Project

This project utilizes a custom-trained LLM for a chatbot.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on a Windows system.

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
````

This command creates a new directory named `venv` in your project folder, containing the virtual environment.

### 2\. Activate the Virtual Environment

Before installing dependencies or running the program, activate the virtual environment.

```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

You should see `(venv)` prepended to your command prompt, indicating that the virtual environment is active.

### 3\. Install Dependencies

Once the virtual environment is active, install all necessary libraries using the `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all the required packages listed in `requirements.txt`.

### 4\. Run the Program

After all dependencies are installed, you can run the main program.

```bash
python .\chatbottrain_llm_from_scratch.py
```

This command will execute the chatbot training script.

```
```
